# A collection of best practices used in the minor web

## General Coding

### Naming Conventions
Code should be easily readable. Most of our best practices stem from this golden rule

- Use descriptive variable and function names
`locationMarker` instead of `lm`
- Only abbreviate words when instantly understandable
`info` instead of `information` is fine but `locMark` instead of `locationMarker` takes more time to understand and should be avoided.
